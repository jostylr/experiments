# Mt. Washington Improvement Association: Membership

The Mt. Washington Improvement Association (MWIA) is an all-volunteer organization that has been working to benefit our neighborhood since 1885\. In addition to sponsoring and funding community events and opportunities, the MWIA works with officials at the city, state, and federal levels on issues ranging from the impact of development pressure, transportation, public safety, parks, schools, and zoning.

Current MWIA dues for calendar year 2014 are:

<tr><td style="width:150px">First time members</td><td>$19</td></tr>
<tr><td>Renewing members</td><td>$40</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sponsoring members</td><td>$100</td></tr>
</table>

If $19 or $40 is beyond your budget please consider joining at whatever level youï¿½re comfortable with. Your investment supports literally thousands of volunteer hours toward neighborhood causes every year. A stable, safe, and thriving neighborhood benefits all of us.
