# Mt. Washington Improvement Association

## Structure

The Mount Washington Improvement Association is governed by a board of directors consisting of:
18 at large directors selected for three year terms (each year, six at large director positions
come up for election); three honorary directors who are the three immediate past presidents of
the Association; an area director (two year term); and area captains elected for one year
terms. In late winter/early spring, a nominating committee consisting of board members and
members of the community nominate a slate of board members; that slate is voted upon at a
community meeting held in June. From among the board members, the new board then elects
officers who serve for one year. The structure and governance of the MWIA are described in the
association's [by-laws][0].

## Meetings

Board meetings are normally held at 7:30 p.m. on the second Tuesday of
each month (except in July and August). Ordinarily, every other Board
meeting is open to the public and held in a location that will
accommodate a larger audience. The Annual Member Meeting is held on the
second Tuesday in June.

## Membership

Membership in the Mt. Washington Improvement Association is open to residents of Mt. Washington, and the annual dues are $40. All MWIA members in good standing (i.e., who have paid their dues in full for the current year) are entitled to vote at the annual meeting of the Association in June. If you would like to join the MWIA, please visit our [membership page][1], or contact the membership coordinator by sending an email to [membership@mwia.org][2].
