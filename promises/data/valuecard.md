* $25 off of custom framings at Framin' Place ... and more than 20 other offers.

See the [Directory of Value Card Offers][0] for all the details. 

**NOTE: This card is only available to MWIA members.**

## How the Card Works

When you join the MWIA you will receive:

* Two numbered copies of the value card. These cards are registered to your address and may only be used by members of your household. Cards may not be transferred or combined with other offers.
* A directory of the details of all merchants' offers.
* A sheet of coupons, for offers that may be used one time only.

Unless otherwise indicated, members of your household may use the card at participating merchants throughout 2014. You must present your card to redeem an offer. Merchants may ask for proof of address. _If there is any question about the details of an offer, please ask the merchant before ordering._ The terms of all offers are at the discretion of the participating merchants.

## One Time Only Offers

Offers that may be used one time only are indicated in the directory with an asterisk.

You must present your value card and the merchant's coupon from the coupon sheet you will receive to redeem the offer.

## Benefits of Membership

Along with the value card, your membership will bring you all of the benefits that come from supporting a strong and effective neighborhood association. In recent years the MWIA has:

* worked to get traffic calming devices installed throughout the community
* helped prevent the old University of Baltimore fields from being developed, and created the new Northwest Park
* supported the expansion of our Mount Washington School to an award-winning K-8 program
* worked to bring the Jones Falls Trail to Mount Washington
* supported improvements to the Mount Washington Arboretum and Luckman Park

All of these successes are achieved with our community's support of the MWIA. And all of them help make Mount Washington the kind of neighborhood where year in and year out our homes maintain and even increase their property values. I hope you'll join me and so many of our neighbors in supporting the MWIA.

**NOTE: The Member Value Card is valid throughout 2014, so the sooner you join the MWIA the sooner you can receive the benefits of membership.**
