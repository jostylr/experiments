# Mt. Washington Improvement Association: Newsletter

The MWIA newsletter is sent to every home in Mount Washington whether you are a member of the
Improvement Association or not. The Newsletter represents the single greatest expense carried by
the MWIA, but it has long been our policy that ALL members of the community should be informed
about our activities on their behalf. We encourage ALL Mt. Washingtonians to join the MWIA.

If you have articles of general community interest, please send them to the newsletter editor at:
[news@mwia.org][0]
