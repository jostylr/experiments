## This is a !!fine start

So I want to move around. 

Using keyremap4macbook or something, I mapped caps lock to be escape on single press with caps lock already being mapped to caps lock. So tap and release caps lock give escape. I also mapped commnd-r to enter when just tapped. Held down, it continues on.
